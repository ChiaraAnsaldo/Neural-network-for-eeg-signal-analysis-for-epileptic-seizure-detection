# Neural network for eeg signal analysis for epileptic seizure detection

The project is for "Neural Networl" exam at university of Pisa. The aim of the project to classify pre-seizure event.
The work consist in:
- Pre-processed EEG data (normalization, dimensionality reduction, class balancing)
- Test of various neural architectures (CNN, GRU, LSTM, RNN) to classify pre-seizure events
